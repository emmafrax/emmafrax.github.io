											<h2>Hello!</h2>
										</header>
										<p>I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Computational Social Sciences and Humanities Lab of the Barcelona Supercomputing Center. I very recently finished a PhD in Computational Social Sciences at the <b><a href="https://www.upf.edu/web/ai-ml">AI&ML group</a></b> of UPF (Barcelona). I am also part of the <a href="https://dgarcia.eu/about-us/"> Social Data Science Lab (Universität Konstanz) </a>, lead by David Garcia. I am interested in polarization in social media, online human interaction and its relation to algorithmic systems. My background is in Physics and AI. Usually working with networks (especially signed) and data analysis.</p>

									<h2>Other interests</h2>
									<p>Besides my motivation towards science and programming I also like to collaborate with projects that advocate for diversity in the STEM communities and/or care for the scientific community and its ties with society. 

									<ul>
										<li> I am part of the <b><a href="https://www.upf.edu/web/etic/igualtat">Equality Comission</a></b>  of the Engineering Department at UPF.</li>
										<li>I was a volunteer member at the <b><a href="https://youngitgirls.org/">Young IT Girls organization.</a></b> as a part of the multimedia team (<b><a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6xcboBh2kMFrWrDGOP4naA?si=f64f1ea09d9744cf">check our podcast #UnCafèAmb!</a></b>), in which we carried out activities in schools and other centers to bring technology closer to society with a gender perspective. </li>
										<li>During my years in the Physics bachelor I co-coordinated an <b><a href="https://www.instagram.com/pintemlafacultat/">artistic project</a></b> based on recognizing and remarking the work of important women in science in order to fight the lack of female roles in the STEM community. It was also aimed at improving the community relations of Physics, Chemisty and Engineering students in the Faculty of Physics and Chemistry (UB). The project proposal was created and presented to the faculty board on June 2018. To achieve the second goal it was built with several participative activities and contests organized through social media.</p></li>
